Hi there! I’m Rjam Abuacan 19 years old and you can call me anytime. Just kidding, you can call me Rjam or jam for short, anything will do. Trivia, did you know that my name came from the first letter of my parent’s name and yeah as you say “Share mo lang? and yes Share ko lang” I live in Bangkal, Makati City yes, it is near the school but unfortunately SOMETIMES I can’t go to school on time because I’m too lazy to wake up early knowing that my school is near my house. It’s the 2nd day of the school year and so far, I’m enjoying the ambience and the professors so far are guiding us on what we need to learn in this course. I’m an extrovert person, I hate being alone all the time. I love to meet new people and make friends with them actually I can make friends that fast because I can adapt to their behavior. I value friendship yes, I have lots of friends but I only trust my real friends. I love to cook and I think that is my passion, I try to experiment on different spices that can make the specific food taste different and better than the traditional one. I play basketball and volleyball but I’m not very good at it. I’m easily to be friend with and I’m open on meeting new people. I play DOTA 2 when I have past time and I can play it all day long. I used to play LOL and I'm also addicted there so I spend money to buy items there.
<br>
The one thing that I can’t forget about is when SHS years came in and I’m the only one who doesn’t have a sit so I have to stand there for almost an hour and luckily one of the professors came so I that person gave me a sit and with that I sat in front, I don’t want that seat but I don’t have choice so throughout the school year I sat there in front. It’s embarrassing I know but I deal with it and everything is alright.
<br>
<br>
I expect this class would be light and the professor will help us understand the subject very well. This class will help us build a good and on standard UI’s. Looking forward that we all have a good grade and we can consume the information and retain in our minds.
<br>
<br>
To sum it up, I'm a friendly person and I love to meet new people and be friend with them. Sometimes I'm lazy but still I want to learn the things that are needed for our future path. I'm a gamer and same with others I want to be one of the best players that people may know. I'm eager to learn and willing to learn.
