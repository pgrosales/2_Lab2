          <p>After several meetings I’ve noticed that the subject that we are facing is heavy but because of the teacher we are not experiencing any difficulties yet. Because I can see the effort that you’re exerting, you made the subject easy the same time we are learning and digesting the ideas that you want us to have. You thought us about considering others opinion and helping one another to have a good, balance decision or way or thinking. Personally, I take others opinion but still do what I want and thinking that, that my idea is better and not considering their opinions, but now I’m starting to incorporate the opinions and idea of others if that will make the project or what I’m doing the best version possible. I’ve realized that we are one in this block, that we support and help one another to be better and I can see that we are enjoying ourselves in this course. I wish that we won’t end up separating and we will graduate as MI 181 together. 

          I hope that this progress will continue, in a way that we will surely learn the lessons very well and not just a waste of time. I can see that you are doing your best to have something from us or any idea that we have, and I appreciate that. Please don’t get tired of doing your best and please always make sure that we understand the subject or the specific lesson that you want to give. I do listen to you and I sometimes notice that some are doing their own business but PLEASE have more patience to them and make do something to make them listen to you again.  Again, miss please help us understand the subject very well because we need it in our future subject. Thank you and keep up the hard work.</p>

          <p>I found it hard to find a problem that the group can relate on, we usually give possible solutions right away and sometimes we just give an easy solution for a problem that doesn’t really need an application to be fixed. After giving different solutions finally we came up with 1 application that will help people find the nearby hospitals. We don’t have the name yet, but we have some of the functionalities with it. One of the functionalities of the application is, you will able to find out if the hospital has vacant room or none. Next is that you may be able to see the information of the selected hospital and the specialists that the hospital has. The application can give you the route to take whenever you are in a hurry to go to the hospital and many features are needed to be discuss by the group. The paper prototyping is also hard to do because we all have our own idea on how the application will look like and we cannot decide on what to use or place the specific feature of the application. We are currently on the process of doing the paper prototyping and I can say that this might be a good one because we are helping one another to make this project good and the best as much as possible.</p>

          <p>Doing website is not new to me because we used to do that way back on senior high school years. The only problem that I encounter is to use the Github repository and Heroku. In Github, I don’t know how to create a repository, so I ask help to my friends that’s why it took several minutes to be able to create a repository. After creating repository, I need to enter my account on Heroku unfortunately I forgot my password and I need to re-enter it again and again but still can’t find the right password for that. I’ve decided to create another account and with that I may be able to launch my simple website in Heroku. It was fun while having these difficulties because I may be able to learn new things, and this gave me a lesson too. I need to have a master list of my accounts for scenarios like this, but I need to make sure that I’m the only one who know where it is. I also want to add that this activity made me refresh my knowledge about creating your own website. I made it without any template because I want to experience the feeling of doing it by yourself, simple yet presentable. I made a mistake about the contrast of the background and the color of the letter that I chose but still I presented it. Next time I will try my best to make sure that everything is readable and can be seen easily. </p>

          <p>I’m also guilty about this UI bad practice because I tend to do some user interface that don’t have the best appearance. For example in the contrast of the background against the text, sometimes I don’t consider the font color if the will match the background, for my perspective it blends well because I love to use dark colors but not knowing that it doesn’t have a good contrast at all. Next is creating a responsive design, this is a must because not all device has the same measurement of screen. You should learn how to do a responsive design so that your work would be compatible in different kind of device. I’ve learned this feature when we have our internship and the teach me a lesson that you should always consider the benefit of all rather than just finishing the program. Next is that you should learn how to cite sources if and only if you get something that belongs to a person or individual to credit their work and as a sign of respect to the creator. Don’t copy without giving them credits. Next, learn about the consistency of the design, it’s better to be simple yet understandable then complex and good design but the user may have a hard time using your program. </p>
